Code Review Lab01  

This program takes name and grade from user and convert this grade to a letter grade, respecting the grading scheme for Cambrian College. 

We don’t allow user to type a grade less than 0 or more than 100. 

To encourage the student, we show him how much is away from the next level, 

and we can put some fancy stuff to push him to do better. 

In my opinion instead of writing to a student "The student is not doing well" if the grade < 50 I would prefer writing his name and encouraging 

him that he can do well next time like "More effort to make, Yes you can!!"

Example: If the grade given is 79.9 the letter grade will be B and the student is just 0.1 away from the next level which in this case is A. 

I used a method that takes the input’s username and grade and return the letter grade, 

we have only to print this method because it returns what we need as result. 

Since the input of the student’s grade is not very precise, we can use float instead of double because float takes only four bytes 

when double takes eight bytes, we don’t need all these bytes to input a student grade. 

I noticed that Java manages bad the String.Format, Instead I prefer using System.out.printf() 

Here the if statement is more precise than the switch statement, it is not easy to use switch with the operators > and < in Java. 

It was not required but we can stop user from typing a string instead of a float as a grade by handling the exceptions, 

that’s what the real-world needs, and we must never trust the user input. 

One interesting thing if we want to go further with this program, we can get all students marks for a particular class for example, 

in this case we can declare an array with dimension as number of students and get the average, the maximum, the minimum and grade letter for each student.
